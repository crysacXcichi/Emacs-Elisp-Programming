The file size is about 2.5 GB, so it may take some time to download depending on your internet speed. Once the download is complete, you will have a zip file named "3-D Custom Girl XP R-4.1.zip". You will need to extract this file using a program like WinRAR or 7-Zip.
 
## Step 2: Extract the game files
 
The next step is to extract the game files from the zip file. To do this, right-click on the zip file and select "Extract Here" or "Extract to 3-D Custom Girl XP R-4.1". This will create a folder with the same name as the zip file, containing all the game files and folders.
 
Inside this folder, you will find several subfolders, such as "data", "mods", "save", and "TAC". You will also find two executable files: "3D Custom Girl.exe" and "TAC.exe". The first one is the main game launcher, while the second one is the mod installer.
 
## Step 3: Install the mods
 
The third step is to install the mods that you want to use in the game. Mods are additional files that enhance or modify the game features, such as adding new clothes, hairstyles, accessories, poses, animations, etc. There are thousands of mods available for 3D Custom Girl, created by various users and communities.
 
To install mods, you need to use the TAC.exe program. This program allows you to browse and select the mods that you want to install from a list of categories. You can also search for mods by name or keyword. To run TAC.exe, double-click on it or right-click and select "Run as administrator".
 
Once TAC.exe is open, you will see a window with several tabs and buttons. The tabs are labeled with different categories of mods, such as "Body", "Hair", "Clothes", etc. The buttons are labeled with different actions, such as "Install", "Uninstall", "Update", etc.
 
To install a mod, simply click on its name in the list and then click on the "Install" button. You can also select multiple mods by holding down the Ctrl key while clicking on them. You can also drag and drop mod files from your computer into the TAC window to install them.
 
Some mods may require other mods as dependencies or prerequisites. For example, some clothes may require a specific body type or skin tone mod to work properly. If this is the case, TAC.exe will notify you and ask you if you want to install the required mods as well.
 
After installing all the mods that you want, you can close TAC.exe and proceed to launch the game.
 
## Step 4: Launch the game
 
The final step is to launch the game and enjoy creating your own 3D custom girl. To launch the game, double-click on 3D Custom Girl.exe or right
