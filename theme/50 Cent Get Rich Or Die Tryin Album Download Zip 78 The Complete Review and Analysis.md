## The Background of Get Rich or Die Tryin'
 
Before releasing his debut album, 50 Cent had a tumultuous career in the music industry. He started out as a protÃ©gÃ© of the legendary producer and rapper Jam Master Jay, who taught him the basics of rapping and making beats. He then signed with Columbia Records and recorded an album called *Power of the Dollar*, which featured the underground hit "How to Rob", where he dissed several prominent rappers. However, the album was never released due to 50 Cent being shot nine times in front of his grandmother's house in 2000. He survived the shooting, but was dropped from Columbia and blacklisted by the industry.
 
Undeterred, 50 Cent began releasing a series of mixtapes with his crew G-Unit, which caught the attention of Eminem and Dr. Dre, two of the most influential figures in hip-hop. They signed him to their joint venture Shady/Aftermath Records and gave him a $1 million advance. They also acted as the executive producers of his debut album, *Get Rich or Die Tryin'*, and provided him with some of their best beats and guest verses. The album was recorded in 2002, mostly at Encore Studios in Los Angeles.
 
The album's title reflects 50 Cent's hustler mentality and determination to succeed in the rap game, despite all the obstacles and enemies he faced. He also wanted to make a statement about his authenticity and credibility as a street rapper, who had lived through poverty, violence, and near-death experiences. He said in an interview:

> "I'm trying to sell music, not my lifestyle. If my lifestyle sells records then I'm lucky. But I'm not trying to create something that's not there. I'm not trying to make myself out to be something that I'm not. I'm just being me."
