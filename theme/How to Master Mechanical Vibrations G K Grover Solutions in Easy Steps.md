Mechanical vibrations are the periodic oscillations of a system with respect to an equilibrium point[^3^]. They are encountered in various engineering fields, such as civil, mechanical, aerospace, and biomedical engineering. Understanding the causes, effects, and control of mechanical vibrations is essential for designing and analyzing dynamic systems.

One of the classic textbooks on mechanical vibrations is *Mechanical Vibrations* by G. K. Grover[^2^]. This book was first published in 1970 and has been revised several times since then. It covers the basic theory and applications of mechanical vibrations, with an emphasis on analytical methods and practical examples. The book is divided into 15 chapters, covering topics such as free and forced vibrations of single degree of freedom systems, two degree of freedom systems, multi degree of freedom systems, continuous systems, vibration measurement and testing, vibration isolation and absorption, vibration of rotating and reciprocating machinery, nonlinear vibrations, and random vibrations.
 
The book is written in a clear and concise style, with numerous figures, tables, and solved problems to illustrate the concepts and methods. The book also provides exercises at the end of each chapter, with answers to selected problems given at the end of the book. The book is suitable for undergraduate and graduate students of engineering, as well as practicing engineers who want to refresh their knowledge of mechanical vibrations.
 
However, the book also has some limitations. The book is quite old and does not reflect the latest developments and trends in mechanical vibrations. For example, the book does not cover topics such as modal analysis, finite element method, vibration control using smart materials and devices, and vibration-based structural health monitoring. The book also does not provide any software or online resources to supplement the learning process. Moreover, some of the notation and terminology used in the book may be outdated or inconsistent with current standards.

Overall, *Mechanical Vibrations* by G. K. Grover is a classic and comprehensive textbook on mechanical vibrations that can serve as a useful reference for students and engineers. However, it may not be sufficient for those who want to learn about the modern aspects and applications of mechanical vibrations. For that purpose, one may need to consult other sources or books that are more up-to-date and relevant.

In this section, we will briefly review some of the other sources or books on mechanical vibrations that are more recent and relevant. These sources or books may cover some of the topics that are not included in *Mechanical Vibrations* by G. K. Grover, or provide a different perspective or approach to the subject. Here are some examples:
 
- *Mechanical Vibrations: Theory and Applications* by S. Graham Kelly. This book was published in 2012 and is intended for undergraduate and graduate students of engineering. It covers the fundamentals and applications of mechanical vibrations, with an emphasis on modeling and analysis using MATLAB. The book also includes topics such as modal analysis, finite element method, vibration control, and vibration-based structural health monitoring.
- *Mechanical Vibrations* by Singiresu S. Rao. This book was published in 2016 and is the seventh edition of a popular textbook on mechanical vibrations. It covers the basic theory and applications of mechanical vibrations, with an emphasis on problem-solving skills and design aspects. The book also includes topics such as nonlinear vibrations, random vibrations, vibration of continuous systems, and vibration measurement and testing.
- *Vibration of Mechanical Systems* by C. Nataraj. This book was published in 2010 and is intended for senior undergraduate and graduate students of engineering. It covers the basic theory and applications of mechanical vibrations, with an emphasis on physical interpretation and mathematical modeling. The book also includes topics such as vibration isolation and absorption, vibration of rotating and reciprocating machinery, nonlinear vibrations, and random vibrations.

These are just some of the examples of other sources or books on mechanical vibrations that one may find useful or interesting. There are many more sources or books available on this subject, depending on one's level of interest and expertise. One can also use online resources such as websites, blogs, videos, podcasts, and courses to learn more about mechanical vibrations.
